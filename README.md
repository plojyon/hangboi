A Hangman bot for Discord

Help text:

**PRIVATE** (send to DMs)
 * `new` - start new game (random word)
 * `status` - check status
 * `help` - display help

**PUBLIC** (in guilds and group DMs)
 * `h!new [strikes]` - start a new game (I'll ask you for a word in private)
 * `h!random` - start a new game with a random word
 * `status` - (only if a game is running) checks the game status

##### P.S.

If you encounter anything *enraging*, *paranoia-inducing* or anyhow *immoral* within my code,
I tell you this: *Stallman was fucking right*.  
I will not accept pull requests. Go make your own bot.
